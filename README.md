# Running

> **Warning**:
> Refresh is a heavy work-in-progress. Expect things to break, things to be deleted, and these instructions to change at any time.

For building instructions, please view the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

1. [View the latest releases](https://github.com/LittleBigRefresh/Refresh/releases)
1. Click the "assets" dropdown on the top-most release.
1. Download the artifact for your OS, extract it somewhere most convenient to you, and run it!

To update, you can simply repeat this process, overwriting the previous files.
In the future updates can (optionally) be handled by Refresh itself.
